# Calculate Total Time of all Video and Audio Files in Folder

A simple python program to calculate the total duration of all the video files in a folder.  
Used it when I'm doing courses to know how long the course will take
Additionally tells how much time it would take on 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2x speeds
Also shows individual file durations

### Instructions
1. Git clone the project / Alternatively download as .ZIP file
2. Navigate into the folder created after cloning or extracting the .ZIP file
3. Run the following commands
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```python
python modify_win_reg.py
```
This is required to modify the windows registry so that this program can be added into the right click context menu for faster access.  
See screenshots below for further clarification  
4. Open any folder and right click on white background. The context menu shows Total Time as an entry.
5. Click on it. Let the code do it's magic ğŸ’–
